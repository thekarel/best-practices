## Simplicity

Once you consider the [importance of attention](attention.md), the value of simplicity becomes obvious. Simple systems are easier to think about, require less mental resources to understand and change.

Because simpler systems are easier to comprehend, the risk of introducing errors is smaller. The less you have to think, the less you will forget or mix up.

Simpler means less bugs.
